 Your main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory. 
 
 ****Rule of thumb: if you only ever need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController), use a module. 
 
 ***If you need multiples of something (players!), create them with factories.
